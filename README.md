## 🌍 Background & Value Proposition

### The Problem
IT projects frequently overlook sustainability aspects due to a lack of structured guidance, leading to missed opportunities for environmentally responsible practices[cite: 7]. 

IT Project Managers and ESG Officers often struggle to start; they are paralyzed by too many options and generic advice when trying to integrate sustainability effectively[cite: 8]. Current alternatives, such as generic checklists or fragmented online resources, are often too complex, not actionable, or not tailored to specific IT project phases[cite: 67].

### The Solution
**SustainaBit Navigator** is an interactive web application designed to help IT and sustainability professionals systematically identify, prioritize, and plan relevant sustainability tasks throughout the IT project lifecycle[cite: 9].

Unlike static lists, this tool offers:
* **Tailored Guidance:** Specific to project archetypes (e.g., Cloud Migration)[cite: 109, 114].
* **Phase-Based Checklists:** Guidance from Pre-Project to Closure[cite: 92].
* **Actionable Metrics:** Concrete KPIs (e.g., PUE, CO2e reduction) rather than vague goals[cite: 141, 143].

## 🔬 Methodology

This project was developed during the **ClimateAction.Tech / AI for Good Hackathon** with the goal of applying product skills to the nascent field of Sustainable IT[cite: 12].

### From Static to Interactive
We utilized resources such as the *Climate Product Leaders Playbook* and the *Green Software Foundation* guidelines[cite: 16]. We realized that while these resources are valuable, they are static. Our goal was to turn these into an accessible, interactive format for non-sustainability experts (IT PMs) and non-IT experts (Sustainability Leads) to facilitate meaningful conversations[cite: 17].

### Hypothesis
If we provide professionals with an interactive, phase-based navigator that delivers actionable tasks and regulatory guidance tailored to their context, they will be able to:
1.  Integrate sustainability effectively.
2.  Reduce overwhelm and indecision.
3.  Achieve measurable sustainability outcomes [cite: 71-73].

## 👥 Target Personas

We designed this solution based on user empathy research for two key profiles[cite: 18]:

### 1. Marco (The IT Project Manager)
* **Pain Point:** Finds generic checklists too complicated and overwhelming[cite: 53].
* **Goal:** Needs to turn high-level sustainability goals into concrete, actionable IT tasks[cite: 59].

### 2. Clara (The Sustainability Lead)
* **Pain Point:** Needs to ensure regulatory compliance and track progress across various technical projects[cite: 60].
* **Goal:** Wants to monitor reporting easily and translate ideas into impact[cite: 58, 59].

> **The "Job-to-be-Done":** Marco needs to stop asking "How do I start?" and start saying "I'm staying on track with sustainability tasks." Clara needs to say "We've made a real impact—and it's all documented."[cite: 83, 85, 94].

## 🚀 MVP Features & Results

The MVP focuses on a specific use case: **Cloud Migration**[cite: 109].

### 1. Project Context Input
Users start by defining the project scope to generate relevant suggestions:
* Project Name & Description[cite: 102, 104].
* Project Type (e.g., Cloud Migration, Software Dev)[cite: 108].

### 2. Prioritization Matrix (Effort vs. Impact)
The core of the navigator is a dynamic matrix that helps users prioritize tasks[cite: 115]:
* **Strategic Imperatives (High Impact / High Effort):** e.g., Define Clear Sustainability Objectives[cite: 120, 128].
* **Quick Wins (High Impact / Low Effort):** e.g., Monitor post-migration energy usage[cite: 131, 132].
* **Medium Effort Tasks:** e.g., Optimize data transfer for migrations[cite: 123].

### 3. Recommendations & Metrics
The tool outputs specific, measurable actions based on the inputs[cite: 138]:
* *Example:* "Prioritizing the assessment of carbon intensity of cloud regions."
* *Metric:* CO2e/kWh of selected region vs. alternatives[cite: 142, 143].
