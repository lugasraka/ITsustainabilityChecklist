## 🌍 Background & Value Proposition

### The Problem
IT projects frequently overlook sustainability aspects due to a lack of structured guidance, leading to missed opportunities for environmentally responsible practices. 

IT Project Managers and ESG Officers often struggle to start; they are paralyzed by too many options and generic advice when trying to integrate sustainability effectively. Current alternatives, such as generic checklists or fragmented online resources, are often too complex, not actionable, or not tailored to specific IT project phases.

### The Solution
**SustainaBit Navigator** is an interactive web application designed to help IT and sustainability professionals systematically identify, prioritize, and plan relevant sustainability tasks throughout the IT project lifecycle.

Unlike static lists, this tool offers:
* **Tailored Guidance:** Specific to project archetypes (e.g., Cloud Migration).
* **Phase-Based Checklists:** Guidance from Pre-Project to Closure.
* **Actionable Metrics:** Concrete KPIs (e.g., PUE, CO2e reduction) rather than vague goals.

## 🔬 Methodology

This project was developed during the **ClimateAction.Tech / AI for Good Hackathon** with the goal of applying product skills to the nascent field of Sustainable IT.

### From Static to Interactive
We utilized resources such as the *Climate Product Leaders Playbook* and the *Green Software Foundation* guidelines. We realized that while these resources are valuable, they are static. Our goal was to turn these into an accessible, interactive format for non-sustainability experts (IT PMs) and non-IT experts (Sustainability Leads) to facilitate meaningful conversations.

### Hypothesis
If we provide professionals with an interactive, phase-based navigator that delivers actionable tasks and regulatory guidance tailored to their context, they will be able to:
1.  Integrate sustainability effectively.
2.  Reduce overwhelm and indecision.
3.  Achieve measurable sustainability outcomes.

## 👥 Target Personas

We designed this solution based on user empathy research for two key profiles:

### 1. Marco (The IT Project Manager)
* **Pain Point:** Finds generic checklists too complicated and overwhelming.
* **Goal:** Needs to turn high-level sustainability goals into concrete, actionable IT tasks.

### 2. Clara (The Sustainability Lead)
* **Pain Point:** Needs to ensure regulatory compliance and track progress across various technical projects.
* **Goal:** Wants to monitor reporting easily and translate ideas into impact.

> **The "Job-to-be-Done":** Marco needs to stop asking "How do I start?" and start saying "I'm staying on track with sustainability tasks." Clara needs to say "We've made a real impact—and it's all documented.".

## 🚀 MVP Features & Results

The MVP focuses on a specific use case: **Cloud Migration**.

### 1. Project Context Input
Users start by defining the project scope to generate relevant suggestions:
* Project Name & Description.
* Project Type (e.g., Cloud Migration, Software Dev).

### 2. Prioritization Matrix (Effort vs. Impact)
The core of the navigator is a dynamic matrix that helps users prioritize tasks:
* **Strategic Imperatives (High Impact / High Effort):** e.g., Define Clear Sustainability Objectives.
* **Quick Wins (High Impact / Low Effort):** e.g., Monitor post-migration energy usage.
* **Medium Effort Tasks:** e.g., Optimize data transfer for migrations.

### 3. Recommendations & Metrics
The tool outputs specific, measurable actions based on the inputs:
* *Example:* "Prioritizing the assessment of carbon intensity of cloud regions."
* *Metric:* CO2e/kWh of selected region vs. alternatives.
